============

The code and plots for the Exploratory Data Analysis project 1 are in this branch of the repository.

##A bit of history
I did this course previously in November but couldn't complete, so this is a post of tidied versions of the code.

##The code
Having seen other approaches, I know my approach to the data tidying is pretty clunky, but it does work. I know all the first bit of the code could be a separate module, but the rubric advises otherwise.

##To peer reviewers
Thanks for looking and for your consideration.
